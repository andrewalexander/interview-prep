# linked-list-reverse


As taken from the original problem:
```
Write a function which, given a linked list, returns that same linked list reversed.

Examples

Given: A -> B -> C -> (null), returns C -> B -> A -> (null)

Given A -> (null), returns A -> (null)
```

The code in this repo emits the following output, demonstrating at least one solution to the problem:
```
original = A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F -> G -> H -> nil
reversed = nil -> H -> G -> F -> E -> D -> C -> B -> A
```
