# interview-prep

Wasn't sure what else to call this, as I don't really know when/if I am ever looking to go through an interview process again. These are just the typical interview questions that are usually pretty good at showing people how they think about code and solve certain kinds of problems. I tend to give these kinds of questions when interviewing people, so like to keep myself fresh and honest about how to approach these kinds of problems.

Common things you see/learn about a candidate from these questions are how they handle decisions between "recursion vs. iteration", "stacks vs. queues", "nested ifs/switch cases vs. maps", "maps vs arrays/arraylists", and probably many more. But the biggest is around how willing are they able to accept a known non-perfect solution and move on with it. As a wise man once told me "Pick a direction, and stick with it."

These also wouldn't be complete without a linked list problem or two. Some binary search trees and sorting tend to round out the problem sets these days.

I found an [older repo](https://github.com/codingforinterviews/practice-problems) with some good questions, but no solutions, so I started making my own, with little twists since I didn't have anybody to ask disambiguating questions. Hopefully my solutions seem clear enough, but if anything could be done better/made clearer, please keep me honest! I am a fan of learning and working to correct mistakes constructively, but mutual respect is a necessary prerequisite.
